# PolkADAPT Subsquid Adapter

A PolkADAPT plug-in to communicate with the Subsquid APIs. The PolkADAPT Subsquid Adapter extends the multichain namespace of PolkADAPT with data sets from Subsquid data sources. The adapter allows clients (e.g. Explorer UI) to augment the data from other adapters with the trusted third party data from Subsquid resources.

For general information and installation instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/polkascan/polkadapt/tree/main/projects/core#readme) file of the `@polkadapt/core` package.
